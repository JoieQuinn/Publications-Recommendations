#### Lacking Vision: Insights into the Automatic Classification of Emotion in AMCs The Walking Dead
Full-text copy of paper presented at the Sixteenth Australasian International Conference on
Speech Science and Technology (6-9 December 2016 - Parramatta, Australia)

**Abstract** Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is in huge demand in our high-tech world, 
but can SER detect emotion with near-human accuracy? To explore this question, we must 
first explore others: What is near-human accuracy in SER? And: How much is that accuracy 
influenced by visual prosody? This study consists of two parts: The first contrasts the 
difference in emotional perception in near-natural speech when audio is presented alone, 
then in conjunction with visual stimuli. The results create a baseline for human auditory 
SER, which is used to judge a basic automatic SER classification model using prosodic, 
semantic, and temporal features.

#### Suicidal Tendencies: The Automatic Classification of Suicidal and Non-Suicidal Lyricists Using NLP
Full-text copy of paper co-authored with Matthew Mulholland and presented at the Sixth 6th International 
Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (14-18 October 2013 - Nagoya, Japan)

**Abstract** Can natural language processing be used to predict the likelihood that a musician
will commit or has committed suicide? In order to explore this idea, we built a corpus of songs 
that includes a development set, a training set, and a test set, all consisting of different 
lyricists. Various vocabulary and syntactic features were then calculated in order to create a 
suicide/nonsuicide song classifier. The features were input into the Weka machine learning suite
and tested with an array of algorithms. We were able to achieve up to a 70.6% classification rate 
with the SimpleCart algorithm, a 12.8% increase over the majority-class baseline. Our findings 
suggest that syntactic and vocabulary features are useful indicators of the likelihood that a 
lyricist will commit or has committed suicide.
